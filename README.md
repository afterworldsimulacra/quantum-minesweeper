### Quantum Minesweeper
for UTS Quantum Hackathon  
(code by Akira Li and Jacky Ly, in collaboration with Joshua Muzik and Salha Alghoraibi)


This project is an 8x8 minesweeper with 10 entangled mines (only 5 of which are definitively dangerous) such that when the player clicks a mine, there is a 50/50 chance of it actually being a mine. However, if a mine did not trigger a game over, then the other mine entangled with it will definitively trigger a game over if hit. Think of it as a *Genshin Impact 50/50* (sorry).
